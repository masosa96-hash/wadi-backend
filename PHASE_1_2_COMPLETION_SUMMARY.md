## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**WADI is 25% complete with the foundational systems in place.**

The next critical step is implementing **real-time run streaming (Phase 4)**, which is the core product differentiator. After that, adding presets (Phase 3) will round out the MVP for a solid beta launch.

**Recommended Path to Beta:**

1. Add routes for billing (5 min)
2. Implement Presets (2-4 hrs)
3. Implement Real-time Runs (4-6 hrs)
4. End-to-end testing (1-2 hrs)
5. **Launch Beta** 🚀
